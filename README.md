# Snake-Game
Got bored so I decided to make a small game


### To run:

To run, simply clone the repository and click the "run" button. A window will appear and the game will commence as soon as an arrow key is pressed. Hitting the side will cause "game over" and running into the own snake body will cause "game over". As well, pressing the exact opposite arrow key (ie pressing "up" then "down") will also cause the game to terminate. There is a score card indicated in the top left of the window to keep track of the score. 

Once the game is terminated, you can simply restart it by clicking "run" again.

Have fun and enjoy!
